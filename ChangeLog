TODO:
* merge continous extents
* add support for checksums
  * add support for ext4 extents checksum
* add support for ext4 directory entry tail
* have date time functions return 0 if not set

* add support for EXT4_EA_INODE_FL
* libfsext_inode_read_data_reference
  * add support for extents header depth > 0 in inode
* add support for EXT2_COMPRBLK_FL
* add support for hash tree directories
  * can be read, but none of the hash tree data structures are used
* directory replace array by data structure that is more efficient for large
  number of comparisions, e.g. a b-tree.

* ext2 without dynamic inode information

* ext2 with +8G sparse file
* ext3 without dynamic inode information
* ext3 with dynamic inode information
* ext4 without dynamic inode information
* ext4 with dynamic inode information
* without sparse superblock
